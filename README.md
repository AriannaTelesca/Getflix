### Team collaborators:

## The mission:
In this exercise, we created a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

We were inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Youtube...  The goal is to display a catalog of movies and TV series.

#### Where: BeCode Brussels
#### When: 5 August 2022
#### Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP

### Must-have features:
- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- Include a search bar and sort by filters. 
- Make a secure code. 
- Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

## The project: BesToBe
We decided to create a platform which will catalogu what we find to be the best videos on youtube. The name is **BesToBe**, which came from Bestube, but sound better and even rhymes with "place to be".

The point is therefor to have diffent categories of must watch Youtube videos, from youtube classics to the best cooking videos that we know of.  

To do it we use the **Youtube Data api** using PHP language.

### Team roles*:
- Backend: Sophie and Arianna
- Frontend: Bhama
- Project manager: Jilani

*Note that the roles where define to have some structure at the start of the project but that each person had to work on both front and back end tasks.
